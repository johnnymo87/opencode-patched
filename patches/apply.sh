#
# PATCH SET (v1.17 line, rebased 2026-06-11 from the v1.15 line):
#   1. gemini-empty-parts.patch   (PR #28669) - pad empty Gemini/Vertex parts arrays
#                                               (gemini.ts lowerMessages + transform.ts normalizeMessages)
#   2. tool-fix.patch             (PR #16751) - synthetic step-start boundaries (tool_use/result mismatch)
#   3. cache-thinking-skip.patch  (#17883)    - cache breakpoint scans past trailing thinking/reasoning blocks
#   4. retry-cap.patch            (local)     - MAX_RETRIES=8 + backoff jitter (Vertex/Gemini runaway cure)
#   5. vim.patch                  (PR #12679) - vim keybindings, re-ported to the new
#                                               packages/tui/ TUI package for 1.17 (TUI moved
#                                               out of packages/opencode in 1.16/1.17).
#                                               Re-ported to v1.17.4 2026-06-12 (prompt/index.tsx

#                                               one-liner became a multi-line .catch((error) => {...});

#                                               history.append was otherwise intact).
#   6. sqlite-foreign-key-wrap.patch (local)  - catch nested/wrapped foreign key constraints
#                                               on modern effect-drizzle error wrappers
#   7. event-session-scope.patch (local)      - optional ?session_ids=a,b,c filter on GET /event
#                                               (pool-of-K-serves per-session SSE; bead workstation-x8wi)
#
# DROPPED on the v1.17 line (see workstation docs/plans/2026-06-11-opencode-1.17-cutover-runbook.md):
#   - prompt-loop-cache.patch (#25367) + cache-aligned-compaction.patch (#25100):
#     cost-cache optimizations that touch the rewritten event-sourced prompt.ts/compaction.ts.
#     Not redundant-by-upstreaming (1.17 still full-reloads each loop iteration), but dropped
#     pending a measured cache-economics pass on 1.17 (tracking-cache-costs skill) — whether they
#     still help on the rewritten loop is unknown, and a wrong cache patch silently burns money.
#   - eager-input-streaming.patch: SUPERSEDED by upstream. v1.17.2 transform.ts options() sets
#     toolStreaming=false for @ai-sdk/google-vertex/anthropic and non-claude @ai-sdk/anthropic
#     (better scoped than our patch, which also disabled it for first-party claude).
#   - instance-state-partition.patch: DROPPED on the v1.17.7 cutover. Upstream
#     v1.17.7 ships commit 87c33b3 (fix(plugin): reuse active server for client
#     requests, issue #29772), which routes plugin SDK calls through the active
#     listener so plugins reuse its InstanceStore instead of materializing a
#     second one via the in-process Default webHandler. That was the empirically
#     observed trigger of the Question-tool hang. NOTE: upstream KEPT
#     Layer.makeMemoMapUnsafe() at server.ts:125 (the narrow plugin-bridge, not
#     our memoMap approach; the unmerged share-listener-runtime branch = our
#     approach was NOT taken). Verified droppable via upstream regression test
#     (httpapi-listen.test.ts "plugin client requests reuse the listening server
#     instance") + live Question-tool repro on v1.17.7-patched. See
#     docs/plans/2026-06-15-v1.17.7-cutover-drop-instance-partition-{design,plan}.md.
#   - mcp-reconnect.patch: 1.17 remote MCP connection is oauth-aware (McpOAuthProvider + SSE
#     fallback + connectTransport Effect); the patch's naive inline transport reconnect bypasses
#     oauth and can't call the Effect connect helpers from an async execute() without re-architecting
#     through EffectBridge. Deferred (QoL, not safety-critical).
#
# History (v1.15 line): the big caching.patch (opencode-cached PR #5422) was dropped 2026-06-02
# (upstream applyCaching does the moving-tail anchor); bus-eager-subscribe (#27959) + bus
# instance-context (#28051) dropped as upstream-merged in v1.15.5+; prefill-fix dropped at v1.15.12.
